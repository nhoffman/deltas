	Abstract = {SUMMARY: ROCR is a package for evaluating and visualizing the performance of scoring classifiers in the statistical language R. It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage. AVAILABILITY: http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de. ROCR can be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Running within R, it is platform-independent. CONTACT: tobias.sing@mpi-sb.mpg.de.},

	Abstract = {{\OE}{\^\i} checking is a laboratory information system (LIS)-based tool that detects patient and laboratory quality control errors. By using hemoglobin A (HbA) data, we developed a novel approach to summarizing and presenting patient {\OE}{\^\i} values to address limitations of current {\OE}{\^\i} check algorithms. {\OE}{\^\i} values were calculated from intrapatient pairs of (n = 55,327) measured during 2 years in a single HbA referral or a university hospital laboratory. Three-dimensional {\OE}{\^\i} -time ({\OE}{\^\i} T) and percentile limit graphs were constructed. Cumulative distribution function analysis was used to explore clinical utilization. The {\OE}{\^\i} values T graphs showed that HbA increase asymmetrically over time. Although the 2.5 to 97.5 and 5.0 to 95.0 percentile {\OE}{\^\i} check limits were similar for both sites, the referral laboratory‚{\"A}{\^o}s 0.5 to 99.5 percentile limits were wider. For acute patient care environments, we recommend limits of ‚{\"A}{\`\i}3.5% and 1.8% for measurements between 0 and 60 days and ‚{\"A}{\`\i}4.0% and 2.0% for measurements between 60 and 120 days. For the outpatient environment, we recommend limits of ‚{\"A}{\`\i}4.2% and 2.1% and 5.0% and 2.5% for measurements between 0 and 60 days and 60 and 120 days, respectively. {\OE}{\^\i} checking can be significantly improved with customization of limits set by population and interobservation period. Because LIS systems are incapable of these customizations, customers must become advocates for these modifications.},

	Abstract = {Dealing daily with various machines and various control specimens provides a lot of data that cannot be processed manually. In order to help decision-making we write specific software coping with the traditional QC, with patient data (mean of normals, delta check) and with criteria related to the analytical equipment (flags and alarms). Four machines (3 Ektachem 700 and 1 Hitachi 911) analysing 25 common chemical tests are controlled. Everyday, three different control specimens and one more once a week (regional survey) are run on the various pieces of equipment. The data are collected on a 486 microcomputer co connected to the central computer. For every parameter the standard deviation is compared with the published acceptable limits and the Westgard's rules are computed. The mean of normals is continuously monitored. The final decision induces either an alarm sound and the print-out of the cause of rejection or, if no alarms happen, the daily print-out of recorded data, with or without the Levey Jennings graphs.},

	Abstract = {Laboratory diagnostics, a pivotal part of clinical decision making, is no safer than other areas of healthcare, with most errors occurring in the manually intensive preanalytical process. Patient misidentification errors are potentially associated with the worst clinical outcome due to the potential for misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy. While it is misleadingly assumed that identification errors occur at a low frequency in clinical laboratories, misidentification of general laboratory specimens is around 1% and can produce serious harm to patients, when not promptly detected. This article focuses on this challenging issue, providing an overview on the prevalence and leading causes of identification errors, analyzing the potential adverse consequences, and providing tentative guidelines for detection and prevention based on direct-positive identification, the use of information technology for data entry, automated systems for patient identification and specimen labeling, two or more identifiers during sample collection and delta check technology to identify significant variance of results from historical values. Once misidentification is detected, rejection and recollection is the most suitable approach to manage the specimen.},

	Abstract = {Through the present delta value check used in quality control programs is a powerful tool for detecting random errors in clinical chemistry analysis, it has some problems, such as missed true errors and delays in reporting time, because it also has the potential of showing erroneous positive results. Recently, new calculation methods for delta check with delta difference, delta percent change, rate difference, and rate percent change have been suggested by Lacher and Connelly (Clin Chem 34:1966-1970, 1988). Based on this new delta check method, we made the new criteria of which calculation method is applied to the clinical chemistry tests, i.e., the differential application of rate and delta check, and selectively applied the new method to 17 chemistry tests in order to solve the above problems. The applied criteria were the time dependence of the test item and the coefficient of variation of the absolute delta difference. Calcium, inorganic phosphorus, total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, and chloride were classified as delta difference calculation method group; glucose and cholesterol as delta percent change group; creatinine, total and direct bilirubin as rate difference group; and urea nitrogen, uric acid, ALP, ALT, and AST as rate percent change group. With the previous criteria by Whitehurst et al. (Clin Chem 221:87-92) for 5045 specimens, the check-out rate was 47.8% (2,411 out of 5,045), and the positive predictive value was 0.41% (10 out of 2,411). For the new criteria, the check-out rate was 12.7% (621 out of 5,045), and the positive predictive value was 1.8% (nine out of 621).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Each report entry is evaluated by a supervisor, who decides whether to accept the result or to re-assay. With this program, 8.4% of all results were included on the report, 1.9% were re-assayed, and 0.83% were judged to be in error and corrected.

	Abstract = {Background: Manual validation of laboratory test results is time-consuming, creating a demand for expert systems to automate this process. We have started to set up the program "LabRespond", which covers five validation levels: administrative, technical, sample, patient, and clinical validation. We present the evaluation of a prototype of an automated patient validation system based on statistical methods, in contrast to the commercially available program "VALAB", a rule-based automated validation system. Methods: In the present study, 163 willfully altered, erroneous test results out of 5421 were submitted for validation to LabRespond, VALAB, and to a group of clinical chemists (n = 9) who validated these test results manually. The test results rejected by three or more clinical chemists (n = 281) served as a secondary reference standard. Results: The error recovery rates of clinical chemists ranged from 23.9% to 71.2%. The recovery rates of LabRespond and VALAB were 77.9% and 71.8%, respectively (difference not significant). The false-positive rates were 82.7% for LabRespond, 83.6% for VALAB, and 27.8-86.7% for clinical chemists. Using the consensus of three or more clinical chemists as the secondary reference standard, we found error recovery rates of 64.8% for LabRespond and 72.2% for VALAB (P = 0.06). Compared with VALAB, LabRespond detected more (P = 0.003) erroneous test results of the type that were changed from abnormal to normal. Conclusions: The statistical plausibility check used by LabRespond offers a promising automated validation method with a higher error recovery rate than the clinical chemists participating in this study, and a performance comparable to VALAB.},

	Abstract = {I describe a system of quality control based on computer detection of changes in individual patient test results. This system, called "delta check," was used to follow all the tests performed by the clinical chemistry laboratory in a 1200-bed hospital. Analysis of 22 months' experience indicates that specimen misidentification is a serious problem in the clinical chemistry laboratory. Over a nine-month period, errors were most frequent in the results for total thyroxine, total calcium, and total protein. Instances of laboratory error detectable by the delta check system are not detected by other currently used methods of quality control. This system therefore appears to be a valuable asset to the clinical laboratory},
